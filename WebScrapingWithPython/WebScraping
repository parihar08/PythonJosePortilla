Main things we need to understand:

1. Rules of WebScraping
    - Always seek permission to web scrap
2. Limitations of WebScraping
    - Every website is unique, which means every web scraping script is unique
    - A slight change or update to a website may completely break your web scraping script
3. Basic HTML and CSS


Main Frontend components of a website:

HTML - Used to create basic structure and content of a webpage
CSS  - Used for design and style of a webpage, where elements are placed and how it looks
JS   - Used to define the interactive elements of a webpage

When viewing a website, the browser shows us the HTML and some CSS and JS that the website
sends to our browser

- Python can view these HTML and CSS elements programmatically, and then extract information
  from the website
